Elliptical Billiards
===============================

Have you ever wondered what pool would be like if the table were an ellipse
instead of a rectangle? Me neither. Not until I came across [this Numberphile
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KHCuXN2F3I). Like me, you probably
don't have one of these in your area, so if you want to try playing, you
need to look elsewhere. Like this repository.
